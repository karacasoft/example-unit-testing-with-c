## Example Unit Testing with C

This repository is provided as an example to write C code with tests. It is just to put a framework on how to do this stuff on C, so it definitely has flaws and there's probably much better ways to do this with unit testing frameworks.

## Usage
### Requirements
* gcc
* make

### Running
```
$ make
```
to build object files.

```
$ make test
```
to run the tests.
